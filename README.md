# telekom-voip-srv

Tool for automatically updating a host file with the SRV records of a
given hostname.

This tool allows to automatically update a host-file with these records.
This is useful when using a PBX without SRV resolvement capabilities for
the SIP host.

I'm using this script on OpenWrt for a Auerswald COMpact 5020 VoIP.

## Usage

See the Script and the inlined comments.
